Verify Import Paths & Dependencies

Check all imports for accuracy and correct relative paths.

Ensure all referenced modules, assets, and hooks exist and are properly exported.

Replace redundant or circular imports with modular shared utilities if needed.

Routing & Navigation

Confirm that all navigation buttons, sidebars, and route links point to valid routes.

Ensure react-router-dom or the routing framework in use is properly wired.

Validate that route guards (auth checks, org scoping) function as intended.

Button & Interaction Logic

Verify every button, link, and action (e.g., “Refresh”, “View Details”, “Open Calendar”) executes its intended function.

Ensure no redundant or dead buttons exist.

Add missing handler logic if necessary.

Confirm all async actions are error-handled and loading states are present.

UI/UX Quality Review

Conform to Superior One’s UI Gold Standard:

Evaluate component hierarchy for simplicity and readability.

Optimize for responsiveness (mobile/tablet/desktop).

Convert fixed pixel values to relative units (rem, %, vw/vh) as needed.

Use Tailwind’s responsive breakpoints for mobile readiness.

Workflow Integration

Validate this component’s end-to-end role in the system workflow.

Data fetching (from backend APIs or context)

State updates (React Query, Redux, Zustand, etc.)

Navigation to subsequent steps (load creation → dispatch → invoicing, etc.)

Ensure all critical data paths (props, hooks, API responses) are correctly wired.

Efficiency & Maintainability

Eliminate redundant logic and repeated queries.

Merge overlapping functions or components when appropriate.

Ensure all API calls use shared fetch utilities with consistent error handling.

Optimize rendering and re-render triggers.

Safety & Error Handling

Add error boundaries where needed.

Validate all external data before rendering.

Ensure secure handling of tokens, sensitive data, or environment variables.

Check that forms and modals sanitize input and handle validation errors gracefully.

Enhancements (If Justified)

You may add small, high-impact improvements if they:

Improve user experience or clarity

Fill clear workflow gaps

Simplify redundant steps

Do not introduce unnecessary complexity

Code Quality & Standards

Ensure consistent TypeScript typings and prop interfaces.

Use clear naming conventions and JSDoc/TSDoc where appropriate.

Ensure ESLint and Prettier formatting compliance.

Testing & Verification

Recommend key unit or integration tests (with React Testing Library or Vitest).

Suggest mock data or fixtures for dashboards that depend on live APIs.
