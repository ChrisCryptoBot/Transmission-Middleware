Transmission MVP Roadmap and Action Plan
Phase 1: Build Core MVP Components (Months 1–3)
In the first phase, focus on developing the core engine that makes strategies adaptive and risk-controlled. Aim to complete an MVP within about 6–8 weeks. Key components to build first:
Plugin/Engine Interface: Create a mechanism to plug in any user trading strategy (“engine”) into the system. For example, define a base Engine class that users can subclass with their strategy logic, and a Transmission class that runs it. This SDK approach ensures the platform is strategy-agnostic from day one. Provide at least one example engine (e.g. a simple VWAP Pullback strategy) to test the whole pipeline end-to-end and to include as a built-in strategy.
User Constraint Engine: Implement a module to enforce user-defined and prop-firm constraints (e.g. daily loss limit, max trades per day, consistency rules). This acts as a real-time gatekeeper that blocks or adjusts trades violating the user's risk parameters. By making the constraint engine the first layer, you address funded traders’ biggest pain (failing challenges due to rule violations) immediately.
Risk Governor: Build a risk management core that adjusts position sizing and overall exposure according to risk limits. For instance, automatically scale down trade size after a series of losses, or flatten positions when a maximum drawdown is reached. This ensures the strategy adheres to risk thresholds (like max % of equity at risk or drawdown limits) on each trade and cumulatively.
Market Regime Classifier: Develop a basic regime-detection component to identify market conditions (trend vs. range, high vs. low volatility) using simple technical indicators (e.g. moving average slopes, ATR ratios). The regime classifier will allow the system to toggle or modify strategy behavior based on market context. Start with a coarse classification (for example, “Trending” vs. “Choppy”) that can inform the strategy when to be more aggressive or conservative.
Execution Guard: Implement safeguards around order execution quality. This includes checking conditions like spread, slippage, and liquidity before placing trades. For example, if the bid-ask spread is above a threshold or order book depth is too thin, the Execution Guard might delay or avoid a market order. Similarly, integrate rules like canceling orders that aren’t filled within a time limit, or preferring limit orders when slippage risk is high. These protections improve live trading outcomes and differentiate the platform (most retail platforms “just send orders” without this layer).
Minimal Dashboard & Logging: Set up a simple dashboard to display vital status information – current regime, active risk limits, and any rule overrides triggered. At MVP, this could be a lightweight web UI (possibly built with Streamlit for speed) showing, for example, “Market Regime: Bullish Trend” or “Trade Blocked: Daily Loss Limit Exceeded.” Comprehensive analytics aren’t needed yet, but transparent logging of decisions (e.g. “Trade X not executed due to high slippage”) is crucial for user trust and debugging.
During Phase 1, iteratively test these components with your own trading (dogfooding). Connect Transmission to a simulated or small real trading account and run your personal strategy through it. This will validate that the Execution Guard and Risk Governor behave as expected under live conditions. It also produces a track record and insights you can document (e.g. showing that the system prevented a rule violation or adjusted to a volatility spike effectively). By the end of Phase 1, you should have a functioning MVP “Transmission Core” that can take a basic strategy and trade it adaptively and safely in real-time.
Phase 2: Beta Testing with Prop Traders (Months 4–6)
With the core in place, open up a private beta to validate the product with real users. Recruit a small group of ~10–20 prop firm traders or serious retail traders to test the MVP for free in exchange for feedback. Provide hands-on support to these beta users as they integrate their strategies:
Onboard Beta Users: Help each user plug their existing strategy into Transmission (using the Engine SDK). Ensure the system is configured with their prop firm’s rules and personal risk preferences.
Monitor and Gather Feedback: Closely monitor beta users’ trading performance and how the system intervenes. Collect qualitative feedback on usability (Was configuration intuitive? Did the dashboard make sense?) and quantitative results (Did they avoid hitting drawdown limits? Are they passing evaluations more often?).
Iterate and Fix: Use the feedback to refine the platform. For example, if a trader finds the regime classifier too simplistic or gets false signals, tweak the logic. If certain prop firm rules weren’t covered, update the constraint engine. The beta period is your chance to catch edge cases and improve robustness.
Document Case Studies: As beta traders see success (e.g. someone passes a funded evaluation or significantly reduces their daily losses), document these wins as case studies. Testimonials and real-world results will be powerful proof points later.
Core Feature Completion: Ensure all must-have features for launch are solid by the end of the beta. This includes having at least one proven default engine running, a stable risk governor, and clear documentation/onboarding materials. Less critical wishes (like a polished UI or multiple built-in strategies) can be queued for later.
The goal of Phase 2 is product-market fit validation – confirming that Transmission genuinely helps real traders. By the end of this phase, you should have confidence (and evidence) that the MVP solves the targeted problems, and you’ll have a small pool of enthusiastic early adopters.
Phase 3: Launch and Scaling (Month 7+)
With a validated product, proceed to a broader launch. Position Transmission as an “adaptive trading middleware” geared especially towards prop firm traders and systematic traders seeking risk management. Key steps in the launch phase:
Public Launch Offering: Release the platform publicly (e.g. via a website and downloadable app) with a clear value proposition: emphasize that it makes any strategy adaptive, risk-aware, and prop-firm compliant out of the box. Offer a free trial or free tier, then a subscription (e.g. ~$99/month) for full access.
Marketing and Community: Leverage the success stories from beta. Publish content such as a blog or video case study showing how Trader X passed their prop evaluation using Transmission’s risk controls. Share these in prop trading communities, Reddit, Discord, YouTube, and on your own channels. The messaging should target the pain point (e.g. “Stop blowing prop firm challenges – let the Transmission guard your strategy”).
Focus on Core Features: At launch, highlight the core differentiators that competitors lack – advanced risk management, regime adaptation, and prop-firm rule enforcement built into the trading workflow. Make it clear that features like mobile apps or extensive strategy libraries are not the focus now. Users are getting a lean, specialized tool that dramatically improves their existing strategy’s survival and compliance.
Support & Documentation: Provide clear documentation, quick-start guides, and possibly tutorial videos. Early users might need guidance to trust the system with live capital. Good onboarding will reduce churn. Also set up support channels (email or a Discord) to handle questions, as prop traders may have urgent needs if something goes wrong.
Initial Pricing Strategy: Don’t undervalue the product – beta feedback and prop traders’ willingness to pay (since it directly influences their ability to make money or not lose accounts) supports a premium price point. For example, start with ~$99/month after a free trial. Emphasize the ROI: one saved evaluation fee or one prevented blow-up justifies the cost.
Which features are launch-critical vs. post-launch? Ensure all MVP components are fully functional at launch (the constraint engine, risk governor, execution guard, regime classifier, and a basic dashboard). These are the core selling points. In contrast, defer nice-to-have features until post-launch to avoid delaying release. For instance, a highly polished UI, a mobile app, support for dozens of different strategy "engines," or advanced analytics can be added later without compromising the core value. This approach keeps the launch focused and achievable.
Post-Launch Enhancements (Months 7 and beyond)
Once the product is launched and you have early customers, you can start expanding features and improving the platform incrementally. Prioritize enhancements that either increase user acquisition (appeal to new segments) or increase retention (give existing users more value), but only after validating the core. Some post-launch roadmap items:
Additional Strategy Engines: Add a few more built-in adaptive strategy modules (e.g. ORB breakout, mean reversion engines) as optional templates. These can attract users who may not have their own strategy and want something out-of-the-box, and they enrich an eventual strategy marketplace.
Advanced Analytics & Reporting: Develop more in-depth performance analytics and visualizations (beyond the MVP dashboard). For example, detailed trade logs, equity curve analysis, and risk reports (Sharpe, drawdowns, etc.) can be introduced post-launch. These features improve the user experience but aren’t strictly required for the platform to deliver its core value initially.
Backtesting Module: Integrate a backtesting harness so users can test their strategies with Transmission’s adaptive layer on historical data. This could leverage existing Python backtesting libraries (Zipline, Backtrader) or a custom solution. It’s a complex feature, so it was intentionally not in MVP, but it will be important for users to trust and refine their strategies offline before risking real money.
Engine Marketplace: If strategy “engines” are pluggable, plan a community marketplace where users can share or sell their custom engines. This can drive engagement and network effects. It’s a longer-term project (after building a sizable user base) – likely a Phase 3 or 4 initiative. When ready, implement a submission/review system and perhaps a revenue-sharing model for paid strategies.
UI/UX Improvements: Continuously refine the interface. Post-launch, gather user feedback on the dashboard and overall UX. You might develop a more sophisticated web interface or even a standalone desktop app for lower latency execution. Also consider a mobile companion app for notifications (e.g. “Strategy paused due to risk limit”) once core functionality is solid.
Multi-Broker and Asset Support: Extend integrations to more broker APIs and asset classes. If MVP launched with, say, only futures via one broker, later add support for forex, stocks, or crypto exchanges based on user demand. Ensuring the architecture uses modular broker connectors will make this expansion easier.
Each of these enhancements should be guided by actual user needs observed after launch. The priority is to keep early users successful and happy – that feedback loop will tell you which feature to build next.
Best Practices from Comparable Platforms
It’s useful to learn from existing algorithmic trading platforms, adopting their best practices while avoiding their limitations:
Modular Strategy Framework: Emulate QuantConnect’s algorithm framework approach of separating strategy logic, risk management, and execution into distinct modules. QuantConnect, for example, lets users plug in a Risk Management model that can modify trade targets before they reach the execution stage
quantconnect.com
. Transmission should do the same – intercept strategy signals and apply the Risk Governor and Constraint Engine rules before any order is placed. This modular design makes the system flexible and robust, as each component (strategy, risk, execution) can evolve independently
quantconnect.com
.
Robust Risk Controls: Offer out-of-the-box risk management tools similar to or better than those in pro platforms. For instance, NinjaTrader offers account-level risk settings that will automatically liquidate positions once a daily loss limit or profit target is hit
ninjatrader.com
. Transmission’s Risk Governor should provide at least that level of protection (automatic stop-out at defined drawdown, etc.), and ideally more nuanced controls (position sizing rules, max concurrent trades, correlation limits, etc.). Advanced risk features that institutional platforms use – like sector exposure limits or flash-crash detectors – can inspire future improvements
quantconnect.com
.
User-Friendly Scripting & APIs: Make the platform as accessible as TradingView or MetaTrader in terms of letting users define strategies. TradingView’s Pine Script and MetaTrader’s EAs became popular because they lower the barrier for strategy coding. For Transmission, ensure the Engine SDK is well-documented and consider providing examples or a simple GUI-based configuration for non-coders. A smooth experience for importing or writing a strategy will drive adoption.
Community and Marketplace: Take a page from TradingView and NinjaTrader’s ecosystems – a community of traders sharing strategies or add-ons greatly increases platform stickiness. Encourage early users to share their custom “engines” and insights. Down the line, a curated marketplace (similar to MetaTrader’s Market or NinjaTrader’s ecosystem) can be introduced, where users can get verified strategy modules (with performance stats) and even purchase third-party engines. This not only provides value to users but also creates a potential revenue stream (e.g. commission on sales).
Performance and Reliability: From day one, prioritize reliability like MetaTrader and NinjaTrader do – since live trading is real money, the middleware must be stable. Use best practices like extensive logging, fail-safes (for example, if the system loses connection or crashes, it should default to closing or not opening positions). Also, consider providing a simulation mode (paper trading) for users to trial strategies risk-free, akin to how many platforms have a test mode.
In summary, adopt the strengths of existing platforms (modularity, risk tools, community features, ease of use) while focusing on Transmission’s unique value: the adaptive intelligence layer. Where others require the trader to manually adjust or code everything, Transmission should handle adaptation and risk automatically – that’s its competitive edge.
Technical Stack Recommendations
Choosing the right tech stack early will accelerate development and ensure the platform can scale and integrate well:
Core Language & Libraries: Python is recommended for the core engine logic and strategy SDK. Python has a rich ecosystem of trading libraries (for data handling, indicators, backtesting) and is widely used among quants. The Transmission concept already aligns with Python (e.g. leveraging frameworks like Backtrader or QSTrader) and an example MVP code snippet uses Python classes. Python’s flexibility will speed up development of the regime classifier and risk logic, and it’s easier to hire for in fintech startups. That said, keep performance in mind – critical sections (like execution handling) can be optimized or even implemented in a faster language later if needed.
Backend vs Frontend: For the user interface, start with a web-based approach. A simple web dashboard (possibly built with a Python web framework or Streamlit) allows quick iteration and easy access for users (no complex installation). At the same time, consider offering a desktop app wrapper for users who want to run locally for lower latency. An Electron app that bundles the Python backend could work, as suggested in the planning docs. In fact, ultimately providing both options (a cloud web app and a local desktop app) is ideal – use the web for convenience and the desktop for performance-sensitive cases.
Open Source vs Proprietary: A hybrid approach (open-core) can be advantageous. Open-sourcing the fundamental library (Transmission Core) that includes the adaptive logic and plugin interface can attract community contributions and trust. Developers and prop firms are more likely to adopt a tool they can inspect and even modify. Meanwhile, you can keep proprietary the surrounding services – e.g. a hosted cloud dashboard, premium engines, or advanced analytics – as monetizable features. This model has worked for many dev tools and trading platforms (QuantConnect open-sourced their engine “Lean” while running a paid cloud service, for example).
Cloud Infrastructure: Even if supporting local deployment, design with cloud scalability in mind. Use containerization (Docker images) for the strategy engine execution so it can be deployed on cloud servers easily. For a SaaS offering, you might run user strategies in isolated containers or VMs for security. Evaluate using message queues or event-driven architecture for handling real-time data and signals (for example, a Kafka or Redis Pub/Sub to feed market data into engines and to broadcast signals to the UI). Also ensure databases are in place for logging and analytics (initially this could be as simple as writing to CSV or a SQLite, but plan for a more robust time-series DB or cloud database as you scale).
Broker and Data Integrations: Choose a tech stack that simplifies integration with broker APIs and data feeds. Python again has an edge here, with existing APIs (like Interactive Brokers’ Python API, CCXT for crypto, OANDA and IG markets REST APIs, etc.). Early on, use well-documented REST or WebSocket APIs to get market data and execute orders. For example, Interactive Brokers or a popular prop trading broker’s API can be integrated during MVP to test live trading. Abstract the broker connection in your architecture so that adding a new broker (with perhaps a different API or asset class) requires minimal changes to user code. This flexibility will be important as users request new integrations.
In terms of front-end tech (if you later build a custom web UI beyond Streamlit), a modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, etc.) could be used, communicating with a Python backend via REST or WebSocket. But to start, it’s perfectly acceptable to use high-level tools (like Streamlit or Electron) to get the product in users’ hands quickly without spending too much time on boilerplate UI work.
Early User Validation Plan
Validating the product with real traders early is crucial. This will not only prove out the concept but also help you iterate to a solution that truly fits the market:
Dogfooding (Proof of Concept): Before even inviting others, use Transmission in your own trading. Set up the MVP with your personal strategy and run it in parallel to how you would normally trade (at least in simulation or with small capital). Track the outcomes: Did the automation prevent mistakes? How often did the Execution Guard halt a bad trade? Share these results publicly (e.g., blog about “How I used Transmission to improve my strategy’s Sharpe ratio” or similar). This builds credibility and provides baseline metrics.
Target Prop Firm Traders for Beta: Prop firm evaluation traders are an ideal early user group – they have urgent pain points and are tech-savvy enough to try new tools. Engage with them through forums or Discord groups and offer the beta as a solution to help pass challenges. Work closely with a handful of these traders in Phase 2 as described. Their success (or failure) will be the best validation. Success criteria might include: a higher pass rate for evaluations, fewer rule violations, or simply strong user retention (if they keep using it after seeing it save their account).
Collect Feedback & Metrics: During the beta, implement ways to collect usage data (with consent). For example, log every time the system blocks a trade or switches regimes. These stats can be turned into marketing points (“Transmission saved Trader Y from breaching the daily loss limit 3 times in one month”). Also gather feedback through surveys or interviews focusing on what users like, find confusing, or wish it did. Iterate quickly on minor fixes (bugs, UI tweaks) even during the beta period to show responsiveness.
Iterative Development: Use the beta period to fine-tune the order of feature development. If users unanimously request a feature that was slated for later (for example, a certain indicator in the regime classifier, or a way to manually override the system), consider adjusting your roadmap. The roadmap should remain flexible to real-world input – the phased plan is a guide, but user needs come first.
Build Social Proof: As prop traders in the beta achieve results, ask for permission to share their stories (anonymized if necessary). Having 2-3 solid testimonials or even verified trading records will be invaluable for the official launch. Prop firms themselves might take notice if their candidates start passing more frequently; this could open doors for partnerships in the future.
Throughout early validation, maintain close contact with users. Treat it as a co-development phase with your target market. This not only helps create a better product, but also creates evangelists – traders who feel they had a hand in shaping Transmission are likely to spread the word. By the end of this validation stage, you should have data-driven confidence that the platform delivers (or clear ideas on what to adjust if not), setting you up for a successful broader launch.
By following this roadmap, you will build Transmission in a logical sequence: first nail the critical adaptive and risk-management features, then prove their value with real traders, and finally broaden the offering. The emphasis on concrete steps – from coding specific modules to engaging beta users – ensures that you’re not just building technology, but building a solution that traders will actually use. This phased approach (MVP → Beta → Launch → Expansion) balances ambition with pragmatism, so you can deliver a transformative trading platform while managing risk and scope along the way. Good luck with building Transmission!
